STM32F407G-DISC1 Board Hardware Design

I designed this hardware for my intership assignment at TUBITEK BILGEM Embedded Systems and VLSI Design Department.

This is 4 layer PCB which consist of STM32F407G microcontroller, STM32F103C8T debugger, CS43L22-CNZ headphone&speaker amps, MP45DT02TR-M digital microphone and
LIS302DLTR gyro sensor.
